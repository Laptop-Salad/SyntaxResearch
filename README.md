PROGRAM - Write pseudocode for each
1. Printing: Print "Hello world.".
2. Variables: Save "Hello world." to a variable and print.
3. String concatenation: Save "Hello" and "world" to two separate variables. Concatenate them and print.
4. Addition: Save two numbers 2 and 3 to two separate variables. Add them together and print.
5. Subtraction: Save two numbers 3 and 2 to two separate variables. Subtarct them and print.
6. Division: Save two numbers 6 and 2 to two separate variables. Divide them and print.
7. Multiplication: Save two numbers 10 and 5 to two separate variables. Multiply them together and print.
8. Modulo: Save two numbers 10 and 2. Modulo 10 by 2 and print.
9. IF: Save "cat" to a variable and create an if statement. If a variable is "cat", print out "Gives cat a fish".
10. IF-ELSE: Save "cat" to a variable and create an if statement. If a variable is "cat", print out "Gives cat a fish". Else, print out "I dont know what that is".
11. IF-ELSEIF-ELSE: Save "cat" to a variable and create an if statement. If a variable is "cat", print out "Gives cat a fish". Elseif variable is "dog", print out       "Gives dog a bone". Else, print out "I dont know what that is".
12. Function: Call a function that prints "Hello world."
13. User Input: Get user input and save it to a variable, then print it out.
14. While Loop: Get user input and save it to a variable, while that input does not equal "cat", continuosly ask for input again. If it does equal "cat", print out     "CATS!".
15. For Loop: Print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.
16. Classes: Create a class Fruit with attributes: colour, name. and create a Fruit object called banana with attributes: colour="yellow", name="banana". 
17. Arrays: Create an array with the following strings: "banana", "orange", "mango". And print out item 1.
18. Comments: Print out "Hello world." and add a comment above it that says "Prints out 'Hello world.'.
19. Function with parameter: Write a function called add with two parameters x and y. In the function body, return the sum of both variables. Call this function         with 5 and 3 and print its output.
20. Booleans: Save two values True and False to two variables. Print these variables out.
21. Builtin Function: Use a function to return the maximum of two numbers: 10, 5 and print the largest number.
22. Function with default value: Write a function called add with two parameters x and y. In the function body, return the sum of both variables. Call this function       with 5 and 3 and print its output. Set y to a default value of 6.
23. Multiline Comment: Print out "Hello world." and above it write a multi-line comment saying "Prints in out 'Hello world.'" on the first line and "In [language]"     on the second line.
24. Conditions: Write a program that checks if the number 7 is greater than 8. If so, it should print "7 is greater than 8", otherwise it should print "7 is not         greater than 8". 
25. Calculation: Print out the result of the calulation: (5 * (5 + 5)) / 2.
26. Multiple Function Calls: Write a function that prints out "Hello world." and call it three times.
27. Recursion: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number n. Call the function with the number 5 and print out the result.
28. Increment: Print out the value of 5, incremented by 1.
29. Decrement: Print out the value of 5, decremented by 1.
30. Printing The Contents Of An Array: Given the array ["Goodbye", "world", "."]. Iterate through the array and print its contents.
